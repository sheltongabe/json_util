# json_util
Utility program for c++ file i/o in a json format

-This program is designed to simplify the process of file saving and loading
of aggregate objects, by storing them in a json format.
-Most of the time I imagine this will be stored to a file however, given the json
is readable as a string at various points it could easily be manipulated at the users
will, such as streamed to a nodejs server.
